My own light lisp-interpreter written on PHP.

## checklist
1. ~~Parse code into list of lexemes~~
2. ~~Make ast tree from list of lexemes~~
3. Make interpreter that will run our ast (in progress)
4. Must support modules and be extended
5. Must support functions and variables definition
6. Access PHP functions from lisp code
